bachelor portal aims to provide a way for GIU students to access bachelor project opportunities
offered to them. This portal will tackle the whole process of the bachelor project, including the preparation
from lecturers, coordinators, TAs, companies, employees, external supervisors, and student registration
until the final grading process.
